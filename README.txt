The Backordered Custom Description plugin lets you add a custom message for the products whose stock status is set to BACKORDER. It is extremely easy to use and highly effective. Simply activate the plugin, and the Backorder link will appear on the left admin menu of WordPress. The plugin page will show the list of all the products that have the status of BACKORDER. In addition to that, a custom description field will appear under the INVENTORY section of the product page.
